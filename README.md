# Introduction

## Background



The Tutors Open Source Project is a collection of components & services supporting the
creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. The project
supports 3 complementary perspectives - the Learner, Educator & Developer experiences. It was originally developed by Eamonn de Leastar, beginning around 10 years ago as a python application with similar principles as it has today - ingesting markdown content to generate either a static site or a zip file which could be uploaded as a lab to Moodle. It has evolved over the past decade, keeping to the same principles, but has been adapted to use modern technologies.

## Objectives

My objectives for this project were as follows:

1. Create a more engaging learner experience, with a fresh, modern interface &
improved user experience.
2. Improve the developer experience by creating a monorepo and tidying up the
codebase.
3. Open up the project to contributions from the open source developer community.
4. Bring exposure to the Tutors Open Source Project by presenting it to a wider
audience.


## Motivation

I initially wanted to get on board with the project after semester 1, where I was a user of Tutors daily. I found the user experience of the software hard to get used to, and wanted to get my hands on the codebase to modernise the frontend design, in order to help me navigate Tutors easier myself for the duration of the course. Over time, I gained an acute appreciation for Tutors. It's open source
